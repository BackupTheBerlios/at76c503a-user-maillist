Please be more specific.  A good problem report should include what you
are trying to achieve, what you are doing and what you are getting.
Neither seems to be described well.

Please avoid non-technical terms (like &quot;gets off the ground&quot;) unless you
are absolutely sure that everybody understands what you mean.

If you need general help with wireless networking, it's probably a wrong
list.  I'm sure there are good resources about Linux wireless on the
web.

&gt;<i> In case I haven't exhausted all the possibilities and it has something
</I>&gt;<i> to do with the unsettling warning,
</I>
You didn't describe a single command.

&gt;<i> []$ iwconfig
</I>&gt;<i> lo        no wireless extensions.
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> Warning: Driver for device eth1 has been compiled with version 22
</I>&gt;<i> of Wireless Extension, while this program supports up to version 20.
</I>&gt;<i> Some things may be broken...
</I>
I believe all common stuff should be OK.  Support for wireless
extensions 21 and 22 is only present in pre-releases of Wireless Tools.

&gt;<i>  what should I do next?
</I>
If you have reasons to suspect that the problem is driver specific,
describe it.  Remember three keywords: goal, action, result.  Make sure
each is covered.

If the problem is generic, I suggest doing some search first, maybe
finding a more generic list.  Still, you'll need to post the details,
not just that you &quot;exhausted all the possibilities&quot;.

One thing useful in either case would be to bring the interface up and
scan:

ifconfig eth1 up
iwlist eth1 scan

&gt;<i> [FWIW, iwconfig is the latest, &quot;Wireless-Tools version 28&quot; (wireless_tools.28)]
</I>
It supports wireless extensions up to version 20.  You'll need 29-pre21
beta for v21 and v22 support.
