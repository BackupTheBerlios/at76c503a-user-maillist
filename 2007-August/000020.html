<PRE>Hello Mark,

It's expected that the old drivers won't build, as the kernel API keeps
changing.

&gt;<i> I downloaded 0.16 from cvs and it compiled without error. On rebooting

</I>
That's unclear.  Does it mean that wlan0 doesn't exist?

&gt;<i> I am unable to bring the interface up with
</I>&gt;<i> ifconfig wlan0 up or with iwlist wlan0 scan.
</I>
Again, it's unclear.  Are there any error messages from ifconfig, or the
interface just stays down?

Scanning won't work until the interface is up.

&gt;<i>  There are no errors (as far
</I>&gt;<i> as I can tell) reported in dmesg. lsmod shows that at76_usb is loaded.
</I>
Can you post the kernel messages?  What does iwconfig show?

&gt;<i> I have had to drop back to kernel v.2.6.20 (which is a pain because Yum
</I>&gt;<i> automatically upgraded my nvidia drivers to match the 2.6.22 kernel so

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My question (1) :
</I>&gt;<i> Does anyone else have at76_usb working with a 2.6.22 kernel? (and
</I>&gt;<i> ideally anyone on FC6?)
</I>
I believe I tried Linux 2.6.22 with no problems at all.  Although I
don't think I did it on FC6, as I upgraded to FC7 long ago.

&gt;<i> My question (2) :
</I>&gt;<i> Do I require wireless-tools &gt; wireless-tools-28-1.fc6?
</I>&gt;<i> If so this will be a non-trivial exercise on FC6 as when I tried to
</I>&gt;<i> update (using Yum) from the &quot;development&quot; repository (v.28 is the latest
</I>&gt;<i> available in &quot;core&quot;) to wireless-tools-29-0.1.pre21.fc8 it wanted to

</I>&gt;<i> about every package installed... - it eventually failed dependency

</I>
at76_usb has no specific requirements for wireless tools.  Any recent
version should be fine.
