<PRE>Hello all,

I have been running the at76c503a driver quite successfully for a number
of years now (the latest being v.0.14dev on a  2.6.20 kernel) on Fedora
Core x (currently FC6).

Today a kernel update became available in the Fedora repository so I
upgraded. I now have the following : (uname -a)

2.6.22.1-32.fc6 #1 SMP Wed Aug 1 15:15:33 EDT 2007 i686 i686 i386
GNU/Linux

My current (0.14dev) at76 driver failed to build (I can post error
messages if required) but I was not concerned as I had seen the
announcement about 0.16 and thought it about time for an update anyway.

I downloaded 0.16 from cvs and it compiled without error. On rebooting
however wlan0 failed to load. I am unable to bring the interface up with
ifconfig wlan0 up or with iwlist wlan0 scan. There are no errors (as far
as I can tell) reported in dmesg. lsmod shows that at76_usb is loaded.

I have had to drop back to kernel v.2.6.20 (which is a pain because Yum
automatically upgraded my nvidia drivers to match the 2.6.22 kernel so
at the moment I don't have an X session!).

My question (1) :
Does anyone else have at76_usb working with a 2.6.22 kernel? (and
ideally anyone on FC6?)

My question (2) :
Do I require wireless-tools &gt; wireless-tools-28-1.fc6?
If so this will be a non-trivial exercise on FC6 as when I tried to
update (using Yum) from the &quot;development&quot; repository (v.28 is the latest
available in &quot;core&quot;) to wireless-tools-29-0.1.pre21.fc8 it wanted to
update Network Tools which wanted a whole new KDE which wanted ... just
about every package installed... - it eventually failed dependency
checks...

Thanks in advance for your help...

Mark
