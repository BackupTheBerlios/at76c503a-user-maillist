<PRE>Hello, Mark!

As we can see, the device is called eth1, so problems with wlan0 are
irrelevant to the driver.  I suspect wlan0 simply doesn't exist.

&gt;<i> iwconfig is more interesting:

</I>
That's a clear sign that the only wireless device is called eth1.

&gt;<i> Grepping dmesg for &quot;eth&quot; and for &quot;Atmel&quot; gives the following:
</I>&gt;<i> eth0: RealTek RTL8139 at 0xd8866000, 00:20:ed:57:73:25, IRQ 18
</I>&gt;<i> eth0:  Identified 8139 chip type 'RTL-8100B/8139D'
</I>&gt;<i> eth1: MAC address 00:30:f1:24:15:d7
</I>&gt;<i> eth1: firmware version 8.101.5-84
</I>
There is no firmware with major version 8.  I assumed that the first two
numbers (major and minor version) would match the versions provided by
Atmel in the text files from which the binary files are generated.

&gt;<i> eth1: regulatory domain 0x30: ETSI (most of Europe)
</I>&gt;<i> eth0: link up, 100Mbps, full-duplex, lpa 0x41E1
</I>&gt;<i> eth0: no IPv6 routers present
</I>&gt;<i> Atmel at76x USB Wireless LAN Driver 0.16 loading
</I>
Since the version mismatch wasn't detected (at least it didn't prevent
registering the interface), I assume that either you have a device that
doesn't require firmware download, or you are not using version 0.16 as
published on berlios.de, or the kernel messages got corrupted somewhere.

If you have any further problems, I suggest that you make sure that you
are running version 0.16.

&gt;<i> Note: Grepping for wlan0 produced no output from dmesg.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, if my assumptions are correct, why is it trying to associate the
</I>&gt;<i> driver with eth1 instead of wlan0 as it has always done in the past?
</I>
This change was made by Guido Guenther with the log message &quot;remove
netdev_name, names of network devices can be set via udev&quot;.  It's
unfortunate that I didn't look at that commit.  Even though removing the
parameter was justified, I don't think changing the default name was a
good idea.

I guess the intention was to use names starting with &quot;wlan&quot; only for
drivers based on mac80211 stack.  Since the mac80211 conversion is
underway, the problem can be expected to be fixed in the next release.

&gt;<i> How do I correct this?
</I>
The answer is generally specific to the distribution.  It's possible to
use ifrename that comes with wireless tools.  Fedora makes it possible
to specify MAC address for the device, and if the device with that MAC
address is named differently, it will be renamed.

Perhaps the easies approach would be just to accept that the device is
called eth1 now.
