Actually this turned out to be easier than I thought. I discovered that my ifcfg-wlan0 file had a blank HWADDR entry. Clearly this was not a problem with the previous version of the driver. Simply putting the appropriate MAC address against this entry in the file meant that the driver now correctly associates with wlan0, picks up all the relevant settings and &quot;just works&quot;.

Many thanks for pointing me in the right direction here...

Once again, thanks for all your work with this driver. It's unfortunate that with this type of software the only time anyone notices your efforts is when something goes wrong. I for one do appreciate what you do...

Thanks

Mark

p.s. 2 cheeky additional questions:
a) When (roughly) do you think the driver could be incorporated into the kernel?
b) Any prospect of WPA support?
