</I>
I might need some help with this.

I'm looking into ifrename at the moment...

If I simply accept that wlan0-&gt;eth1 I will need to change some
configurations. In the following locations:
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/
/etc/sysconfig/networking/devices/
/etc/sysconfig/networking/profiles/default/
I have the files:
ifcfg-wlan0
keys-wlan0
route-wlan0
I have tried copying each of those to *-eth1 in all of the above
locations and rebooting but still the startup screen is full of &quot;Device
not found&quot; messages relating to wlan0 so I guess it is not as simple as
all that.

What else do I need to do to make it think that that wlan0 is eth1? (or
should I simply pursue the ifrename solution?)

Many thanks for your help and support so far.

Mark
